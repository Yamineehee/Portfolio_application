        <p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Yaminee Chaudhary</strong>, currently adventuring through a BTech degree at Symbiosis, Class of 2026. Let’s be real—engineering has been a wild ride with challenges around every corner, but honestly, I’ve come to enjoy the thrill! Tackling new concepts and projects keeps me on my toes and (usually) out of trouble.</p>
        
        <p>Outside the coding life, I’m a dedicated Bharatanatyam dancer, recently achieving the milestone of my <em>arangetram</em>—a moment I’ll forever cherish! The graceful, powerful expressions of Bharatanatyam have me completely hooked, and it’s a passion I hold dear. (Yep, you might catch me practicing a few moves in my head during class!)</p>
        
        <p>When I’m not buried in code or a dance routine, I love exploring new cafes, binging on books, or diving into random projects that catch my interest. Every day is a chance to grow, have a laugh, and see where this unpredictable tech-and-dance combo takes me!</p>
